def matrix_mul(m_a, m_b):
    """
    Multiplies two matrices.

    Args:
        m_a (list of lists): The first matrix containing integers or floats.
        m_b (list of lists): The second matrix containing integers or floats.

    Returns:
        list of lists: A new matrix resulting from the multiplication.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If m_a or m_b is not a list of lists containing integers or floats,
                   or if rows of m_a and m_b are not of the same size.
        ValueError: If m_a or m_b is empty, or if m_a and m_b cannot be multiplied.

    Example:
        >>> matrix_mul([[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[1, 2], [3, 4]])
        [[7, 10], [15, 22]]
        >>> matrix_mul([[1, 2]], [[3, 4], [5, 6]])
        [[13, 16]]
